## Confidential Document
### Challenge: Access a confidential document.

* Navigate to `About Us` and observe a url link `http://192.168.247.136:3000/ftp/legal.md`. Clicking it will bring you to a text file but what is interesting is the `ftp` directory, which seems like this is may contain files like a ftp server would.

* Navigate to `http://192.168.247.136:3000/ftp` and you will notice some interesting files.

* Clicking `acquisitions.md` file will solve this challenge as the name suggests, it is some company related stuff for share holders such as 'acquisitions' matters.
