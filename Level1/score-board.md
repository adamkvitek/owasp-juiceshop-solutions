## Score Board 
### Challenge: Find the carefully hidden 'Score Board' page.

* Using Chrome > Right Click on home page > Inspect > Sources
* Look at `main-es-2015.js` and click the `{}` icon ([pretty-print](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/pretty-print))
* Search for `path` or `score` and you would observe that there is a directory path named `score-board`
* navigate to the url `http://ipaddress:3000/#/score-board` to complete this challenge

_notes: I learnt that theres alot of juicy info in javascript files, good to look out for them and crawl for any interesting keywords. Chrome's pretty-print (the `{}` icon) developer tool is really useful here!_
